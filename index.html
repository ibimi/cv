        <h3>Sewing. <br>Start-up & Development.</h3>
        <p>I started learning to sew when I was 15 years old. It was summer holiday before I got into SS 3, and I had so much time at hand, so I decided to try it out. Prior to this period, fashion designing had always fascinated me so learning sewing was a plus.</p>

        <h3>Eating.</h3>
        <p>Many people have what tickles their fancies when it comes to feeding, and I'm not an exemption. As a matter-of-fact, I love food and I don't reject any meal. With this said, my best food is <strong>Pounded-Yam</strong> and <strong>Ewedu soup</strong>: a Nigerian dish <i>served best when hot</i>, and <i>enjoyed to the fullest, when eaten with bare hands.</i>.</p>
